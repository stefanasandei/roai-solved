    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whimsical town of Widgetville, the mighty Widget Corp stands as the centerpiece, crafting widgets of unmatched quality with a **Ruby** and **Sapphire** magic stones inside. But recently, a trickster sprite seems to have infiltrated the assembly lines, introducing problems and faults to widgets's working procedure and labels. As the company’s freshly appointed Chief Engineering Detective, you are tasked with a mission to unravel this puzzling situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your ultimate goal is to effectively classify widgets into two classes: **Ruby** and **Sapphire**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have recovered the labels for a previous month's supply of widgets, and should use these to classify the remaining widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For every widget, you have an access to the so-called \"The Pulse of the Machine\" -- a unique numerical representation of each widget, which features 8 magic threads (represented by 187 numbers) woven into the central timeless crystal.\n",
    "Therefore, each widget is described by (187 x 8) array. You must use these data to recover the **Ruby** and **Sapphire** labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need to engineer discerning features from the **Pulse of the Machine**, since efficient factory procedures allow you to **only use Decision Tree Classifier** with a limited tree depth as a model, with no hyperparameters change allowed.\n",
    "  - You can read more about Decision Trees in scikit-learn documentation:\n",
    "    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree\n",
    "    - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html\n",
    "    - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html\n",
    "  \n",
    "- You have two levels of difficulty, producing **Efficient** and **Super Duper Efficient** solutions. These vary by the allowed tree depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your classification success will be measured by the ROC AUC metric\n",
    "  - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your solution for each task should not exceed 5 minutes for training from scratch **AND** inference on the validation/test set on the standard Colab non-GPU instance. This **INCLUDES** features generation (working time of the function that transforms initial Pulse of the Machine into a set of features for the model).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will share the test data 48 hours before the deadline\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use test data to create `efficient_test_predictions.txt` and `super_duper_efficient_test_predictions.txt` and share these files with us\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also share this notebook containing your solution so we can reproduce your results and check the time constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "- Aim to create a minimal yet mighty set of derivative features to maintain the elegance and effectiveness of your tools.\n",
    "- The crystals are indeed **timeless** -- be aware that there are no time series involved.\n",
    "- There was a rumor that not only labels, but the data itself was corrupted by evil spirits. Is there a way for a possible recovery?\n",
    "- Ensure your solutions are as clear as the crystal waters of Widgetville’s famed springs by providing them with sufficient documentation."
